# 32-bit MIPS general purpose integer microprocessor & config it on FPGA


## Phases:

### Block diagram:
  The project aims to implement a 32-bit single-cycle MIPS RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor based on Harvard architecture using verilog HDL.The   processor is simulated on ModelSim tool, and Synthesis is made using Intel速 Quartus速 Prime and also implemented on Cyclone速 IV FPGA.

- Write RTL modules in Verilog and instantiate in TOP
- Simulate the TOP in Modelsim with 3 different programs: Factorial program, GCD of 
  two numbers program and Fibonacci sequence program
- Configurated it on Cyclone IV FPGA Kit using Intel速 QUARTIS PRIME
