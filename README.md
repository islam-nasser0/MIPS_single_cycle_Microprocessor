# 32-bit MIPS general purpose integer microprocessor & config it on FPGA


Phases:
- write RTL modules in Verilog and instantiate in TOP
- simulate the TOP in Modelsim with 3 different programs: Factorial program, GCD of 
two numbers program and Fibonacci sequence program
- configurated it on Cyclone IV FPGA Kit using Intel® QUARTIS PRIME
